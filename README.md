# Concentration_game

The bulbs turn on randomly each time only one bulb is on

The player has to move the joystick to the right side - according to the light bulb that was lit

If he moved when the light is on - he will get a point

If he moved incorrectly or too slowly - he will lose a point

Starting a new game - moving the joystick to the upper right corner for a second and then to the lower left corner for another second 
(there is no time limit between these moves)
